## What is this?
HEMA Codex is a learning tool designed for beginner practitioners of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) and Medieval Armored Combat (MAC). Explore techniques inspired by 15th-century manuscripts, including those by Paulus Hector Mair.

The app provides technique cards in easy-to-understand decks, with each deck focusing on a different weapon. Current release features select weapons, with more decks planned for future updates.

Accessibility is keyâ€”audio card reading is available for users with reading disabilities or those who prefer an audio format.
