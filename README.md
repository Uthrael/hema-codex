## What is this?
HEMA Codex is a learning tool designed for beginner practitioners of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) and Medieval Armored Combat (MAC). Explore techniques inspired by 15th-century manuscripts, including those by Paulus Hector Mair.

The app provides technique cards in easy-to-understand decks, with each deck focusing on a different weapon. Current release features select weapons, with more decks planned for future updates.

Accessibility is key—audio card reading is available for users with reading disabilities or those who prefer an audio format.


## Closed Beta testing is now live on Google Play: ##

- To get in, first, you need to join this Google Group https://groups.google.com/g/hema-codex (Your Google email needs to match the one you use for the Android Play Store, or it won’t show up.)

- Once that’s done, you can download the app here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codextenebris.HEMACodex

I need 12 people to install it and play with it for two weeks so I can unlock public release. The app is free, with no ads—just something I’ve put a ton of work into that I’d love for you to check out.

Would be huge if you could help out. Appreciate it!
